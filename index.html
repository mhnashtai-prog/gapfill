        Noreen Hannington, a sixty-three-year-old grandmother of five, arrives at the Tyre and Wheel Company in North London at 8 a.m. every morning. She puts on a greasy apron, rolls up her sleeves and gets ready for the day's work.<br>
        The first customer pulls up in an old van. It has a flat tyre and the driver was lucky to make it to the garage. Noreen puts on her rubber gloves and gets down to work. She casually pulls off the wheel, swings it onto the work bench with one hand and takes it apart. ‘There’s your problem, sir,’ she announces, pointing at a tiny hole in the tyre. Right now, he couldn’t care less about that, since <span id="ref-0">what he feels is more serious: a fast-decreasing sense of his own worth.</span> At least his mates haven’t come to witness him being rescued by a sweet-faced granny!

        Why is Noreen in this line of work, anyway? It’s a family business and when Noreen’s husband died, she decided to keep it going for her two sons, Bill and Fred, then aged only seventeen and fifteen. Before that, her husband had let her watch what went on in the garage, but she had never been allowed to lift a finger. Initially, she doubted her ability to make a go of it, but somehow she managed, and although the boys are now grown up, has never got round to handing over.

    <!-- CHUNK 3 -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="text-box">
        Now the business has expanded to include not only the sons but daughters-in-law, too. With Noreen in charge, it all runs smoothly. ‘Bill handles anything mechanical. Fred does electrical repairs, while I fix flat tyres and anything else to do with wheels.’ She waves at the new computer: ‘I also do the accounts. They keep on at me to think modern, but we don’t need this.’ Bill jokes: ‘We don’t need you, but you’re still here!’
      </div>
      <div class="question-title">‘Keep on at’ in line 34 describes a way of:</div>

        Noreen is indeed still around, lifting well over twelve kilogrammes in weight up to twenty times a day, which is rather surprising, to say the least. As Bill says, ‘Tyre changing’s hard and she shouldn’t be doing it.’ Noreen pulls a face and replies, ‘I’ll stop when I’m eighty-five. Anyway, it was far worse in the old days, when there was less equipment.’ ‘And before that, you were repairing the horses and carts,’ jokes Bill. We all laugh at that one.
      </div>
      <div class="question-title">The writer finds it strange that:</div>
      <div class="choices">
        <div class="choice" data-answer="A" data-idx="3">A. Bill allows his mother to work at her age.</div>
        <div class="choice" data-answer="B" data-idx="3">B. Noreen knows exactly when she will retire.</div>
        <div class="choice" data-answer="C" data-idx="3">C. Bill doesn’t find a way to help his mother.</div>
        <div class="choice" data-answer="D" data-idx="3">D. Noreen does a job that is unsuitable for her.</div>

      <div class="text-box">
        Suddenly it all becomes obvious to me – these friendly jokes create an environment that Noreen loves and, despite her advanced age, she wants to stick it out, even if the work is hard at times. So much so, that on the rare occasions when she does go away, she can’t wait to return. ‘I have just had a wonderful holiday on board a cruise ship. Going to sea made sure I couldn’t come running back to the garage after a few hours! But walking back into the garage meant coming home to me,’ she says fondly.

        Surely all this heavy work must affect her health though? Noreen claims that it doesn’t, though her daughter-in-law mentions recent back trouble. ‘That had nothing to do with the tyres! It was when I was doing those stupid roof tiles,’ says Noreen. ‘We rebuilt the garage and added a first floor. It was quite a nice change to be a labourer for a while, actually.’
